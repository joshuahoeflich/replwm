# replwm
A hackable X11 window manager written in Common LISP.

## Developing
You'll need:
- sbcl
- git
- A Unix-based operating system running X11 (e.g., Linux)
- libX11
- libXinerama
- Xephyr (for experimenting)

Use `make xrepl` to spin up an X-Server inside this one which you can use to develop.
